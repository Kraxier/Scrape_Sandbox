# Web Scraping Dynamic Sites: FAQ

## 1. Why is scraping dynamic websites harder than static ones?
Dynamic websites:
- Load content via JavaScript/AJAX after the initial page load
- Require interaction (clicks, scrolls) to trigger data fetching
- Often use APIs (XHR/Fetch) to fetch data as JSON, not raw HTML
- May render content entirely on the client side (React, Angular, Vue.js)

**Problem:** Traditional scrapers (like `requests` + `BeautifulSoup`) only see the initial HTML, missing dynamically loaded content.

## 2. How do I know if a site is dynamic?
- Right-click â†’ "View Page Source" vs. "Inspect" (DevTools).  
  If data is missing in "Page Source" but visible in "Inspect," itâ€™s dynamic.
- Open Chrome DevTools (F12) â†’ Network tab â†’ XHR/Fetch requests.  
  If you see API calls fetching data, the site is dynamic.
- Disable JavaScript in your browser.  
  If the page shows no data, itâ€™s JS-dependent.

## 3. Whatâ€™s the best way to scrape dynamic content?
### Option 1: Use a Headless Browser
- Tools: Puppeteer, Playwright, Selenium
- Pros: Fully renders JS, can interact with pages.
- Cons: Slower, more resource-heavy.

### Option 2: Reverse-Engineer the API
- Find XHR/Fetch requests in DevTools â†’ Network tab.
- Directly call the API endpoints (much faster).

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Scrapy + Playwright or Splash for selective JS rendering.
- Balances speed and reliability.

## 4. How do I handle infinite scroll or lazy loading?
- **Headless browsers:** Use `page.evaluate()` to scroll and wait for new content.
- **Reverse-engineering:** Look for pagination APIs (e.g., `?page=2&limit=10`).
- **Auto-scrolling tools:** e.g., `scrapy-infinite-scroll`.

---

## 5. How do I avoid getting blocked?
- Rotate **User-Agents** and **Headers**.
- Use **proxies** (residential/rotating IPs).
- **Limit request rate** (add delays).
- Handle **CAPTCHAs** (services like 2Captcha).
- **Persist sessions/cookies** to mimic human browsing.

## 6. What if the site changes its structure often?
- Prefer **API scraping** (more stable).
- Use **robust selectors** (semantic HTML, not brittle classes).
- Implement **automatic retries and monitoring** for broken selectors.
- Use **robust selectors** (**semantic HTML**, not brittle classes).  
  â†’ Choose HTML elements that have *meaning* (like `<article>`, `<section>`, `<h1>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`) instead of random class names like `.x23a1b`.  
  â†’ Example of **semantic HTML**:  
    - `<article>` = a self-contained piece of content  
    - `<nav>` = navigation links  
    - `<footer>` = bottom of the page info  
  â†’ Select by tag names or stable IDs if possible, because they are less likely to change than class names made for styling.

- Implement **automatic retries and monitoring** for broken selectors.  
  â†’ Build your scraper to catch errors (like "element not found") and retry automatically.  
  â†’ Set up alerts or logs to notice when a selector breaks, so you can fix it quickly.

## 7. Should I store raw HTML or extracted data?
- **Store raw HTML/JSON** if the site changes often.
- **Store cleaned data** for efficiency and structured storage (e.g., PostgreSQL).
- Consider **caching** to avoid unnecessary scraping.

---

## 8. How do I scale my scraper?
- **Distributed scraping:** Scrapy + Redis, Apache Nutch.
- **Deploy on cloud:** AWS Lambda, Scrapinghub.
- **Task queueing:** Celery, Kafka.

---

## 9. Is scraping legal?
- Check the siteâ€™s **robots.txt** (e.g., `https://example.com/robots.txt`).
- Respect **Terms of Service**.
- Avoid **DDoS-like behavior** (too many rapid requests).
- **Ethical scraping:** Cache data, minimize server load, follow fair use.

---

## 10. Whatâ€™s the fastest way to scrape dynamic sites?
- If API available: **Reverse-engineer and call the API** directly.
- If no API: **Use Playwright/Puppeteer** in headless mode.
- For large-scale scraping: **Scrapy + Playwright middleware**.

---

## Final Tip ðŸš€
Always start with **DevTools â†’ Network tab** to check if data comes from an API.  
- **If yes:** API scraping is fastest.
- **If no:** Headless browsers are your friend.
