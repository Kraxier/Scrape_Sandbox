# Difference Between JavaScript Websites and Dynamic Websites

JavaScript websites and dynamic websites are related concepts but not exactly the same. Here's how they differ:

## JavaScript Websites
- Primarily rely on **client-side JavaScript** to handle most functionality.
- Often **single-page applications (SPAs)** where content loads dynamically without full page refreshes.
- **Examples**: React, Angular, or Vue.js applications.
- **Content manipulation** happens in the browser after the initial page load.

## Dynamic Websites
- Generate content on the **server** before sending it to the client.
- Can use various **server-side technologies** (PHP, Python, Ruby, Node.js, etc.).
- **Content is customized** for each request based on user, data, or other factors.
- **Examples**: WordPress sites, e-commerce platforms, content management systems.

## Key Differences

**Where processing happens:**
- **JavaScript sites**: mainly in the browser.
- **Dynamic sites**: mainly on the server.

**Initial content delivery:**
- **JavaScript sites** often start with minimal HTML then populate content.
- **Dynamic sites** send complete HTML for each request.

**They can overlap:**
- Many modern dynamic websites use **both approaches** (server-side rendering + client-side JavaScript).
- Some JavaScript websites connect to **APIs** that are themselves dynamic websites.
