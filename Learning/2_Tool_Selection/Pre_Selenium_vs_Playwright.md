# Playwright vs Selenium: Which Should You Use for Web Scraping and Automation?

## 1. Performance & Speed
| Playwright üöÄ | Selenium üê¢ |
|:-------------|:------------|
| Faster execution (built for modern web apps). | Slower due to legacy WebDriver protocol. |
| Auto-waits for elements (no need for explicit `time.sleep()`). | Requires manual waits (`WebDriverWait`). |
| Supports HTTP/2 and WebSockets natively. | Limited to HTTP/1.1. |

**Winner:** **Playwright** (2‚Äì3x faster in benchmarks)

---

## 2. Browser Support
| Playwright | Selenium |
|:-----------|:---------|
| Chromium, Firefox, WebKit (Safari). | Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, IE (wider but patchy). |
| Consistent behavior across browsers. | Inconsistent due to browser-specific drivers. |
| No need to download separate drivers. | Requires drivers (e.g., chromedriver). |

**Winner:** **Playwright** (more predictable)

---

## 3. Ease of Use
| Playwright | Selenium |
|:-----------|:---------|
| Simple API (`page.click()` vs Selenium‚Äôs `find_element().click()`). | Verbose syntax (older design). |
| Built-in screenshots, video recording, and tracing. | Requires third-party libraries (e.g., `screenshot()`). |
| Easy mocking (intercept network requests). | Harder to mock APIs. |

**Winner:** **Playwright**

---

## 4. Language Support
| Playwright | Selenium |
|:-----------|:---------|
| Python, Node.js, Java, .NET. | Python, Java, C#, Ruby, JavaScript, etc. (more languages). |

**Winner:** **Selenium** (if you need Ruby/PHP)

---

## 5. Debugging & Features
| Playwright | Selenium |
|:-----------|:---------|
| Time-travel debugging (record actions). | Basic DevTools integration. |
| Mobile emulation (iPhone/Android viewports). | Limited mobile support. |
| PDF generation (`page.pdf()`). | Not available. |

**Winner:** **Playwright**

---

## 6. Community & Ecosystem
| Playwright | Selenium |
|:-----------|:---------|
| Newer (launched 2020), but growing fast. | Mature (since 2004), vast resources. |
| Microsoft-backed. | Open-source (but fragmented). |

**Winner:** **Selenium** (for now, due to legacy usage)

---

## 7. Stealth & Anti-Bot Bypass
| Playwright | Selenium |
|:-----------|:---------|
| Harder to detect (uses CDP protocol). | Easier to detect (WebDriver flags). |
| Plugins like `playwright-stealth` improve stealth. | Requires `undetected-chromedriver`. |

**Winner:** **Playwright**

## When to Use Which?

**Choose Playwright if:**
- ‚úÖ You need speed and reliability for modern JS-heavy sites.
- ‚úÖ You want built-in features (screenshots, API mocking).
- ‚úÖ You prefer a clean, modern API.

**Choose Selenium if:**
- ‚úÖ You need legacy browser support (IE, old Edge).
- ‚úÖ Your team already uses Selenium.
- ‚úÖ You work with rare languages (e.g., PHP, Perl).

## Code Comparison

### Clicking a Button

**Playwright (Python):**
```python
page.click("#submit-button")  # Auto-waits for element
