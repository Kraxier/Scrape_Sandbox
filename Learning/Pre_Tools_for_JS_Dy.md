# Tools for Scraping Dynamic and JavaScript-Heavy Websites

When scraping modern websites that rely heavily on JavaScript and dynamic content loading, traditional scraping tools often fail because they only see the initial HTML without the JavaScript-rendered content. Here are the essential tools and approaches you'll need:

---

- **Puppeteer (Node.js)** – Google's headless Chrome browser automation.
- **Playwright (Node.js/Python/Java/.NET)** – Multi-browser automation.

### Specialized Scraping Frameworks
