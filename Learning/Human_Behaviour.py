# Human Behaviour 

r'''
Focus on these 4 core behaviors that deliver 80% of human-like results with 20% effort:

Scrolling > Mouse Movement > Action Timing > Typing and Error 

1. Variable Action Timing (35% impact)
* Humans never operate at machine precision. Implement:

2. Organic Mouse Movements (30% impact)
Avoid straight-line pointer motions:

3. Natural Scrolling (25% impact)
The #1 most detectable behavior:

4. Behavioral Patterns (10% impact)
Mimic human interaction quirks:

Behavior	Key Parameters	Ideal Range
Scrolling	speed_factor	0.8-1.5x
Mouse Movement	steps	3-8 steps
Delays	think time	2.5-8.0s
Errors	Mistake probability	3-7%
