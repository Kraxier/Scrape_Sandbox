# Creating a History Right now To See The Progress that i been Made: 
r'''
July 28, 2025:
    1. Thinking What i needed to do next 
    2. Thinking i should create a README.md Organizing all the Files(Low Energy Task, Less Priority)
    3. Going Jump to the Project of Scrapping the Jobs 
    4. How to Document the Timeline 
        Bullet Journal 
            * Documenting What i been Doing in the Past, Present and Plan for the Future 
    5. Documenting the Timeline in Learning 
        * Concept --> Practise --> Feynman Technique

What is the Most Priority 
    1. Create a Project in Playwright (Jobs Scrapping)
    2. Document What is the Current Skill that i have in Playwright and Overall Web Scrapping Skills and Plan for the Future
        * After Documenting Plan for the Deliberate Practice for Concept 
        * How should i Balance Between the Line of Project Approach and Structural Learning
        

Practice is for Practical Implementation
Practise is the Routinely that you needed to do to master something

Plan for Hybrid Approach at Things 
Stacking the Concepts after Applying 
80/20 Rule DONT FORGET THIS STUFF 

Using the Guide of playwright_toscrape_progression thing 

--------------------------

Browser Context and Pages
JavaScript	JavaScript generated content  
1. Implementing ⚡Async (Asynchronous) vs 🔁 Sync (Synchronous) in Playwright and observe the difference 
2. Implementing Multiple Pages and Browser in terms of Opening a stuffs 
3. Implementing Concurrency 

Locating Elements (Selectors)
.text_content() gets all text, including hidden text
.inner_text() gets only visible text

Playwright All Selectors things Implement it

--------------------------

Delayed	Same as JavaScript but with a delay (?delay=10000)
https://quotes.toscrape.com/js-delayed/

Scroll	infinite scrolling pagination
https://quotes.toscrape.com/scroll

Waiting Strategies & Dynamic Content
Learning the State Checking:
Waiting & Auto-Retry 
Playwright All Selectors things Implement it

------------------------------


Action Method for some of the Things 


# No Idea How to Implement this stuff 


Tableful	a table based messed-up layout
https://quotes.toscrape.com/tableful/

Login		login with CSRF token (any user/passwd works)
https://quotes.toscrape.com/login

ViewState	an AJAX based filter form with ViewStates
https://quotes.toscrape.com/search.aspx

Random		a single random quote
https://quotes.toscrape.com/random



1. Fundamental Competence (Beginner)
Basic Usage: Launching browser, navigating pages, simple text extraction
    Uses basic selectors (CSS/XPath)
    Basic page navigation and content extraction
    Handling iframes and shadow DOM
    Managing multiple tabs/windows
    File downloads/uploads
    Taking screenshots/PDFs

    Dynamic Content Handling
        Waiting for elements to appear/disappear
        Handling infinite scroll
        Dealing with lazy-loaded content
        Processing WebSocket data
        Intercepting and modifying network requests

2. Intermediate Proficiency
Complex Interactions: Form filling, dropdown selection, pagination
    Indicators:
        * Implements explicit waits (wait_for_selector, wait_for_timeout)
        * Handles common anti-bot techniques (basic ones)
        * Can scrape multi-page dynamic content
        * Uses more advanced selectors (>> chaining, :has-text())
