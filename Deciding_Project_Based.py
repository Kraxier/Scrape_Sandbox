# My Approach in Learning the Playwright Libraries is Structural Approach or Structured Learning Implementing all of it in Quotetoscrape all the Endpoints right there 
# But Right now it seems in the Tech Industry it much Focus on going to Project Learning approach because you can do something in that area not like law or medicine 
# that it require an Structured Learning approach

So I'm Wondering is it Good Idea to Abandon the Project well not really Abandon because i learn a Quite good amount in structured Learning approach at things and there 
are some concepts behind it to man so maybe that is a good idea 

Prerequisite Part: (After Building the Scrolling Part )
    1. Gather all the Learning So Far 
    2. Figure out the Core or Foundational Learning that i Miss based on the Learning So Far 
    3. Learn That 
    4. And Build a Good Real Project in the Real World Man 
    5. After a 1 Good High Quality Project i needed to start Applying While Also Learning Playwright and Building Things 
        - Figuring out the Deliberate Learning of Playwright 
        - Figuring out the Deliberate Learning of BS4 and Request and Other Tools that i needed 
        - Maybe Going to Scrapy and Some Parts of that
        - As Long the Project are Required i can do stuff  
    
I'm Going to Stop at the Scrolling Website because i can feel like i can do it man this project Learning Based 
    1. If my Goal is to Learn through Project Learning Based it Should be a High quality One 
    2. I need to Rapidly build andd Build Things Through all of it 
    3. After building the Web Scraper Project in Philippines i needed to Observe the Project and let it Run While I'm Building other Things 
    4.
