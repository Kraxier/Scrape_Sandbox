Yes — that warning is important if you're pushing large files to GitHub, especially this one:

playwright/driver/node.exe is 79.48 MB

⚠️ Why this matters:
GitHub limits individual file sizes to 100 MB

Files over 50 MB get warnings (like the one you saw)

Large files (especially .exe, venv/, or libraries) bloat your repo and can slow down cloning, pushing, and collaboration

✅ What You Should Do:
1. Stop tracking your venv/
It’s a virtual environment and should not be in your Git repo.

In your project folder, create or edit .gitignore like this:

markdown
Copy code
venv_PS_Toscrape/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
2. Remove the venv from Git history:
If it's already tracked, run:

bash
Copy code
git rm -r --cached venv_PS_Toscrape
git commit -m "Remove venv from repo"
git push origin main
3. (Optional) Use requirements.txt instead
So others can recreate the environment without pushing the whole venv:

bash
Copy code
pip freeze > requirements.txt
Later, they can do:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv_PS_Toscrape
pip install -r requirements.txt
