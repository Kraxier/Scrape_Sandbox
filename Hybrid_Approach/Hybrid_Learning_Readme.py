# Hybrid Approach in terms of Learning Playwright and Programming 
r'''
Realize i too much Analyze everything and my methodologies in learning 
playwright is Structed Learning which is not good for the Tech Based on 
AI because the argument that Tools Evolve Rapidly so it is really necessary 
to learn how to learn which is the Hybrid Approach to Learning 
'''

# Goal in June 15 - 21 
r'''
Hybrid Approach Learning in Playwright 

Just Focus on BUILDING Program to Scrape the Endpoints in Quotetoscrape
    Learn All the necessary to scrape that 
    Basically Project Oriented Learning 
'''

# Hybrid or Anchor Learning Approach Methodologies 
r'''
Define the Microproject 
    1. Scrape the Javascript
    2. Scrape the Delayed Javascript
    3. Scrape the Infinite Scrolling 
    4. Scrape Tablefull
    5. Viewstate 
    6. Random 

1. Create a Prototype to Scrape everything 
2. Research: to Identify the necessary needed to build Prototype 
3. Implement the Research
    If it == "Work":
        Sligthly Expand the Task
    elif it == "Not Work":
        Fail Log the Error 
    else: 
        Fill any Gaps by Researching the "Core Skills 10% Feature for 90% of the Library"
4. Deliberate Expansion 
    How do I know when to stop expanding a project?
    Apply the 70/30 Completion Framework 
        70%  Microproject Reaches pause and ask 
            Have i Acquired the Core Skil this Project Targeted? 

    Continue Expansion if 
        The Project has genuine Practical Utility or Continue Unlocks new Priority Learning Goals

# Going back to Basics 

r'''
Learning Programming is Different from Learning the Code

Going back to the basics 
    1. Becoming a Better Programmer means good at solving a problem
    2. Only way to become better is to build things from time to time 
    3. You are learning to become Chef instead of Cook 
    Chef means you can understand the principle behind at things
    Cook means following the instruction of the recipe of something and Doesn't know why is it there 
    # Note my examples are bad because i don't understand Cook and Chef but you still get it 

    Logical Thinking, Problem Solving and Understanding the Tools 
    

    Learn to think like a developer 
        Learn to Use the Syntax and the Principle behind it 

    Because you can Encounter that sometimes you can't use the library,function and framework

    Knowing what to code # you can't teach it 
        Experience it on your own to solve it 
        Project Based Learning 

    Balancing the Tutorial and learning things on your own 
        How about you use them 

    Break down the Problems thing
