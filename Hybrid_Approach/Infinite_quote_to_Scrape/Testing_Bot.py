Yes, you can test your Playwright Python bot on BrowserScan, and I'll also recommend several other specialized testing platforms:

âœ… BrowserScan Testing (https://www.browserscan.net/bot-detection)
How to test:

    1. Run your Playwright script to visit https://www.browserscan.net/bot-detection

    2. The site will automatically analyze your browser for:
        Headless browser detection
        WebDriver flags (navigator.webdriver)
        Canvas fingerprinting anomalies
        Screen resolution mismatches
        Plugin inconsistencies

    3. You'll receive a detailed report showing exactly which bot signals your script leaks
        Key features:
            Detection score (0-100% bot-likeness)
            Specific vulnerability breakdown
            TLS fingerprint analysis
            Recommended fixes
