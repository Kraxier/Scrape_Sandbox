To Do List
1. Document the Learning for Space Repetition Thing 
    * Infinite Scrolling 
    * Javascript
    * Delayed  Javascript 
2. Improvement in Infinite Scrolling Code 
Yes, it's necessary to learn these techniques before moving forward.
    Instant scroll jumps → Flagged as bot
    Fixed sleep timings → Pattern recognition
    DOM-based counting → Easily fingerprinted

1. page.mouse.wheel()
    ✅ Anti-detection: Simulates human-like scrolling behavior
    ✅ Precision control: Adjust scroll increments (e.g., 300px vs full page)
    ❗ Your current method triggers "instant bottom" patterns that anti-bots detect
2. page.wait_for_function()
    ✅ Dynamic waiting: Adapts to network speed (no hardcoded delays)
    ✅ Fail-fast: Timeout exceptions reveal loading issues immediately
    ❗ Your time.sleep(2) wastes 40+ seconds unnecessarily for 20 scrolls

3. Batch Extraction with evaluate()
    ✅ 60% faster: Single DOM query vs multiple Playwright roundtrips
    ✅ Atomic operation: Avoids state changes during extraction
    ❗ Your .locator().all() makes 200+ individual DOM calls

1. Scalability
    Your current script fails on:
    Sites with lazy-loading (e.g., "Load More" buttons)
    Websites using scroll-triggered APIs
    # Example of API-based scrolling
2. Anti-Bot Evasion
    Current weaknesses:
        A. Predictable scroll timing
        B. Instant full-page scrolls
        C. No render waiting signals

Critical for Professional Scraping
These techniques solve:

    1. Dynamic content loading (React/Vue apps)
    2. Infinite scroll pagination
    3. Lazy-loaded assets 

Learning Path Recommendation
1. Implement mouse.wheel scrolling (1 hour)
    Simulate human scroll patterns
    Add randomness to scroll distances

2. Master wait_for_function (2 hours)
    Wait for DOM changes
    Handle AJAX-loaded content

3. Learn batch evaluation (1 hour)
    Extract datasets in single operations
    Handle nested data structures

⚠️ Warning: Without these skills, you'll waste weeks fighting:
    Inconsistent data extraction
    IP bans
    Captcha walls
    "Blocked" messages on Behance/Pinterest
