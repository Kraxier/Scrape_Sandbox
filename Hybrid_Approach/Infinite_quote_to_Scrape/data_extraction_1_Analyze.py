    # Used in While Loop for the Condition to be True {Scrolling_attempt_max and scrolling_attempt}
    # Why: We Used Scrolling Attempt Max to not keep Scrolling Forever so we terminate the program once it reaches the maximum attempt
    # Problem: It Will Always Increment at the end of the Loop the Problem is, it will not go back to 0 so Just a Maximum Attempt of Scroll only

    # Description: Counting the Quotes for Every Scroll, If the Quotes are not incrementally adding a new found quotes the program will terminate itself 
    # Description: 
    r'''
    Why:
        * Another Termination program to make it more robust, this program will keep counting the quotes if there are new quotes been found in the infinite scrolling
        But if there are no new Quotes are found it will terminate the program 
        * Caveat: 
            - There are Buffer like scrolling_max and scrolling_fail to not terminate the program if there are no new quotes because the content can load sometimes and 
            take a while to load so it is very important to put some buffering
