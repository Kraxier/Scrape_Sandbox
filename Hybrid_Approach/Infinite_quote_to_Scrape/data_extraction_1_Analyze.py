To Do List
1. Analyze the Third Terminations
2. Analyze the data_extraction of Quotes 
    3. Position Based Extracting 
        - Extracting Content Based on current scroll position 
        - It focuses on content currently in view or just loaded after a scroll action

    # Why: We Used Scrolling Attempt Max to not keep Scrolling Forever so we terminate the program once it reaches the maximum attempt

    Why:
        * Another Termination program to make it more robust, this program will keep counting the quotes if there are new quotes been found in the infinite scrolling
        But if there are no new Quotes are found it will terminate the program 
        * Caveat: 
            - There are Buffer like scrolling_max and scrolling_fail to not terminate the program if there are no new quotes because the content can load sometimes and 
            take a while to load so it is very important to put some buffering

        intial_count_quotes are outside of function so it just count the intial Count 
        and if counting_quotes(Inside the While Loop) (Means It Keep Counting at things)

        IF they have the same X amount of Number it means there are no quotes are found 
        What is a good name scrolling_fail --> scrolling_fail_buffer  

        Explaining the If Statement
            if counting_quotes == initial_count_quotes: # If They have the same Number 
                scrolling_fail_buffer += 1 # Adding the Buffering
                print(f"No new quotes found. Fail count: {scrolling_fail_buffer}") # There are no New Quotes are Found 
                if scrolling_fail_buffer == scrolling_max_termination: # if they have the same number of scrolling_max which is 5 after not getting any quotes 
                    break # It will Simply Stop 
            else: # If counting_quotes and initial_count_quotes are not the same number which means there are New Quotes that found 
                scrolling_fail_buffer = 0 # It will Reset the Buffering 
                initial_count_quotes = counting_quotes # Adding a initial_count_quotes # Which means incrementally adding a new quotes in it's memory 
        Basically the code will break or terminate itself if there are no new Quotes are found after 5 retry of getting that Quotes
