Solving a Robust Termination 
    Triple Safety Net
        
        
        True bottom detection: scrollY + viewport >= pageHeight - 10px

        1. MAX_ATTEMPTS (15): Absolute scroll limit
        Understanding Why Max Attempt are Needed (Absolute Scroll Limit)
            - This is good so the code will not run forever in attempting things
            - Because Sometimes the Detection Logic fails 
            - how i can use This Information 
            - The Logic of this is putting it right to the bottom of while loop
            - putting it to While loop part  
        2. MAX_FAILS (3): Breaks after no new content
        What it is: A counter of consecutive ‚Äúfailed‚Äù scrolls‚Äîthat is, 
        scrolls after which the page didn‚Äôt add any new items.

        Why it helps: Sometimes the site hits an actual end or hiccups: 
        if you scroll three times in a row and nothing new appears, you probably reached the real end.

        # based on My Understanding i needed a metric for this 
            1. Quote Tracking Things 
            2. a Certain Height or the Scroll Position Doesn't Change 
            3. 
            1. Content‚ÄëCount Fails (MAX_FAILS)
You‚Äôre already tracking .quote count and bailing after N ‚Äúno‚Äënew‚Äëitems‚Äù scrolls. This is by far the simplest, most universally applicable check.
Why it matters: Almost every site injects new DOM nodes for each batch of content. If your count doesn‚Äôt budge after 2‚Äì3 scrolls, you‚Äôre almost certainly done.

2. Bottom‚Äëof‚ÄëPage Detection (¬±10‚ÄØpx)
A one‚Äëliner JS check to know ‚ÄúI‚Äôm at the very end of the document‚Äù:

            if new_scroll_pos == prev_scroll_pos:
                print("We Reached the Last Page")

        It Certainly Work but the problem is 
        The Length of the Quote that i Currently Scraped: 80
        Previous Scroll 10485.599609375 Previous Height 12702
        New Scroll 11380.7998046875 New Height 12702

        Maybe Adjusting it for the better thing 
        Also i can just use the If Statement for this not in the while thing 
        but i understand the Absolute Limit Attempt

        Creating a Program where it Track if there are new Quotes that are coming in

        üß† Core Logic (Step-by-Step)
            1. Track number of .quote elements before and after each scroll.
            # Instead of Getting the Quote for Every While Loop which is very slow 
            # i will use only tracking the number of quotes if there are new 
            What is a good Implementation of this? 
                len() --> quotes = page.locator(".quote .text").all()
                if the number of the quotes doesn't increment it means a fail count 
                if the number of the quotes are loaded reset and fail_count to 0 
                if the fail_count reach the threshold it means max fail 
        It seems like it is outside of the Loop in previous counting 
        I needed to put the counting inside the loop man 
        I also need to reset if there are new quotes how i can do it

            It updates your "reference" quote count to the current total number of quotes after a scroll ‚Äî but only if new quotes were found.
            ‚úÖ Why is it essential?
Because without it, you're always comparing to the very first quote count (like 10), even after loading more quotes. That means your "new content detection" logic will always say:

‚ÄúOh, we‚Äôve got more quotes than before ‚Äî great! Reset fail count!‚Äù

‚Ä¶even if nothing new actually loaded.

This line makes sure you‚Äôre always comparing the latest known quote count with the next one after a scroll, like this:
            
            '''
            print(f"There are New Quotes Found so It will Reset to: {scrolling_fail}")

        #     seen_quotes.add(quote.text_content())
        # length_quote = len(seen_quotes)
        # print(f"The Length of the Quote that i Currently Scraped: {length_quote}") # Total Quote is 100 Thing Using the 100 As Condition seems Bad because it is a fixed Number to
