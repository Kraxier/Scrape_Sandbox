# Shallow Learning vs Deep Learning 

# Temptation of Coding
r'''
Quite Notice that i can easily copy the code of the AI but that is shallow learning 
i needed to carefully build it step by step so if i have a question i needed to do it properly 
but first i need to understand the difference between Shallow Learning and Deep Learning 
'''

# Shallow Learning 
r'''
* A Step by step of following tutorials and copy pasting the code without 
understanding the underlying prnciples 

* It involves 
    Copy Pasting 
    Focusing on the Final product of the code instead of understanding behind the why
'''

# Problems in Shallow Learning 
r'''
1. The Real Problem is Debugging the code and adapting to different scenario and context 
2. Struggle with new problems and scalling the projects 
'''

# What does it mean by Deep Learning Fundamentals
r'''
What does it mean by Internalizing the Concepts? 

1. It Give you ability to combine the concepts across domains
2. Comfort in modifying and optimizing and debugging the code without the guidance
'''

# What is the benefit of going to Deep Learning Fundamentals
r'''
1. Ability to do Complex Task which is i certainly needed if i'm gonan be freelancer and coder
2. I can Innovate the COde 
3. Reduce the Dependency of the code itself 
'''
# What is the Cons of Going to Deep learning 
r'''
1. Require Significant of Time so Patience is the key here 
2. Deliberate Practice 
3. Tolerance to Frustration and Stress and Error 
    Based on Andrew Huberman Frustraition is the key for Learning 
'''

# How to Learn from Tutorials and Copy Pasting the Code 
r'''
Copy Pasting, Tutorials often prioritize Efficiency over Understanding 

But to learn through it is to 
    1. Break the code and try to Debug it 
    2. Understand it Line by line 
    3. Modify the Scope of the project 
    4. Explain the Concept of the code itself
